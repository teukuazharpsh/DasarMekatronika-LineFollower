## 🖊️ **Creating a Circuit Schematic**

1. **Log in to EasyEDA**: Create a free account at [EasyEDA.com](https://easyeda.com).  
2. **Start a New Project**: Click **File > New > Project** to create a workspace.  
3. **Add Components**:  
   - Use the *Library Browser* to search and place components.  
   - Connect components using the **Wire Tool** to define circuit connections.  
4. **Annotate Schematic**: Assign labels and part numbers to ensure clarity.  

💡 *Tip*: Keep the schematic clean and organized for easier debugging later.

## 🛠️ **Generating a Netlist**

A **netlist** is a text file that defines the electrical connections between components.  
1. Click on **Design > Netlist** to generate the netlist.  
2. Save the netlist file for reference during PCB layout.  

---

## 🖼️ **Designing the PCB Layout**

1. **Convert Schematic to PCB**: Click **Design > Convert to PCB**.  
2. **Arrange Components**: Place components within the PCB outline for optimal layout.  
3. **Route Traces**:  
   - Use the **Auto Router** or manually route traces for custom control.  
   - Ensure proper trace width and clearance.  
4. **Add Ground Planes**: Use **Copper Areas** for better noise performance.  

🎨 *Pro Tip*: Use different layers for traces (e.g., top and bottom layers) to simplify routing.

## ⚙️ **Configuring Production Parameters**

1. **Set PCB Dimensions**: Adjust board size to match your project needs.  
2. **Define Design Rules**: Configure parameters such as:  
   - Minimum trace width  
   - Via sizes  
   - Clearance settings  
3. **Run DRC (Design Rule Check)**: Ensure there are no design violations before production.

## 📂 **Exporting Output Files**

1. Click **Fabrication Output > Gerber Files**.  
2. Verify the generated Gerber files using the integrated viewer.  
3. Download the files or directly send them to an EasyEDA-compatible PCB manufacturer like **JLCPCB**.  

---

## 🛠️ **PCB Implementation**

1. **Order PCB**: Upload Gerber files to a manufacturer (e.g., JLCPCB or others).  
2. **Assembly**:  
   - Solder components onto the PCB following the schematic.  
   - Use proper tools like soldering iron and magnifying glass for precision.  
3. **Testing**: Power up the PCB and validate its functionality against the design requirements.
